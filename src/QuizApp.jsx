Company Overview - Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics. Overview. IT Structure - The company\u2019s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems. The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data. The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL. Existing Environment. Fabric - Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items. Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode. Existing Environment. Source Systems Contoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company\u2019s website. The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint. Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions. Existing Environment. Product Data POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables: Products - ProductCategories - ProductSubcategories - In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories. Existing Environment. Azure - Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups: DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers Contoso has an Azure subscription. The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric. Existing Environment. User Problems The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric. The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail. Requirements. Planned Changes - Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses: Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation. Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric. Requirements. Technical Requirements The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization. Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers. Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible. The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements: Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access. Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses. Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements: The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items. Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format. No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer. Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data. In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again. Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB. Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed. Requirements. Data Transformation In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1. Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer. Requirements. Data Security - Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements: The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files. The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer. The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers. The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA. You need to ensure that the data analysts can access the gold layer lakehouse. What should you do?",

When you are ready to answer a question, click the Question button to return to the question. Overview. Company Overview - Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics. Overview. IT Structure - The company\u2019s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems. The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data. The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL. Existing Environment. Fabric - Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items. Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode. Existing Environment. Source Systems Contoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company\u2019s website. The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint. Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions. Existing Environment. Product Data POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables: \u2022 Products \u2022 ProductCategories \u2022 ProductSubcategories In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories. Existing Environment. Azure - Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups: \u2022 DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts \u2022 DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers Contoso has an Azure subscription. The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric. Existing Environment. User Problems The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric. The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail. Requirements. Planned Changes - Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses: \u2022 Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources \u2022 Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation. Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric. Requirements. Technical Requirements The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization. Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers. Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible. The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements: \u2022 Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access. \u2022 Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses. Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements: \u2022 The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items. \u2022 Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format. \u2022 No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer. \u2022 Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data. \u2022 In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again. Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB. Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed. Requirements. Data Transformation In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1. Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer. Requirements. Data Security - Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements: \u2022 The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files. \u2022 The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer. \u2022 The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers. \u2022 The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA. You need to ensure that WorkspaceA can be configured for source control. Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution.

The company plans to begin using\nFabric for marketing analytics.\nOverview. IT Structure -\nThe company\u2019s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems.\nThe data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data.\nThe data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL.\nExisting Environment. Fabric -\nContoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items.\nContoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode.\nExisting Environment. Source Systems\nContoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft\nEntra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales\ntransactions that were processed on the company\u2019s website.\nThe company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that\nrelates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each\nentity has a different endpoint.\nContoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)\nbucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300\u00a0MB to 900\u00a0MB and relate to email interactions.\nExisting Environment. Product Data\nPOS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables:\nProducts -\nProductCategories -\nProductSubcategories -\nIn the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories.\nExisting Environment.

The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint. Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions. Existing Environment. Product Data POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables: Products - ProductCategories - ProductSubcategories - In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories. Existing Environment. Azure - Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups: DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers Contoso has an Azure subscription. The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric. Existing Environment. User Problems The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric. The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail. Requirements. Planned Changes - Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses: Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation. Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric. Requirements. Technical Requirements The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization. Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers. Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible. The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements: Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access. Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses. Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements: The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items. Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format. No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer. Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data. In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again. Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB. Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed. Requirements. Data Transformation In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1. Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer. Requirements. Data Security - Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements: The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files. The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer. The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers. The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA. You need to populate the MAR1 data in the bronze layer.

Company Overview - Contoso, Ltd. is an online retail company that wants to modernize its analytics platform by moving to Fabric. The company plans to begin using Fabric for marketing analytics. Overview. IT Structure - The company\u2019s IT department has a team of data analysts and a team of data engineers that use analytics systems. The data engineers perform the ingestion, transformation, and loading of data. They prefer to use Python or SQL to transform the data. The data analysts query data and create semantic models and reports. They are qualified to write queries in Power Query and T-SQL. Existing Environment. Fabric - Contoso has an F64 capacity named Cap1. All Fabric users are allowed to create items. Contoso has two workspaces named WorkspaceA and WorkspaceB that currently use Pro license mode. Existing Environment. Source Systems Contoso has a point of sale (POS) system named POS1 that uses an instance of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines in the same Microsoft Entra tenant as Fabric. The host virtual machine is on a private virtual network that has public access blocked. POS1 contains all the sales transactions that were processed on the company\u2019s website. The company has a software as a service (SaaS) online marketing app named MAR1. MAR1 has seven entities. The entities contain data that relates to email open rates and interaction rates, as well as website interactions. The data can be exported from MAR1 by calling REST APIs. Each entity has a different endpoint. Contoso has been using MAR1 for one year. Data from prior years is stored in Parquet files in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. There are 12 files that range in size from 300 MB to 900 MB and relate to email interactions. Existing Environment. Product Data POS1 contains a product list and related data. The data comes from the following three tables: \u2022 Products \u2022 ProductCategories \u2022 ProductSubcategories In the data, products are related to product subcategories, and subcategories are related to product categories. Existing Environment. Azure - Contoso has a Microsoft Entra tenant that has the following mail-enabled security groups: \u2022 DataAnalysts: Contains the data analysts \u2022 DataEngineers: Contains the data engineers Contoso has an Azure subscription. The company has an existing Azure DevOps organization and creates a new project for repositories that relate to Fabric. Existing Environment. User Problems The VP of marketing at Contoso requires analysis on the effectiveness of different types of email content. It typically takes a week to manually compile and analyze the data. Contoso wants to reduce the time to less than one day by using Fabric. The data engineering team has successfully exported data from MAR1. The team experiences transient connectivity errors, which causes the data exports to fail. Requirements. Planned Changes - Contoso plans to create the following two lakehouses: \u2022 Lakehouse1: Will store both raw and cleansed data from the sources \u2022 Lakehouse2: Will serve data in a dimensional model to users for analytical queries Additional items will be added to facilitate data ingestion and transformation. Contoso plans to use Azure Repos for source control in Fabric. Requirements. Technical Requirements The new lakehouses must follow a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. There will be extensive data cleansing required to populate the MAR1 data in the silver layer, including deduplication, the handling of missing values, and the standardizing of capitalization. Each layer must be fully populated before moving on to the next layer. If any step in populating the lakehouses fails, an email must be sent to the data engineers. Data imports must run simultaneously, when possible. The use of email data from the Amazon S3 bucket must meet the following requirements: \u2022 Minimize egress costs associated with cross-cloud data access. \u2022 Prevent saving a copy of the raw data in the lakehouses. Items that relate to data ingestion must meet the following requirements: \u2022 The items must be source controlled alongside other workspace items. \u2022 Ingested data must land in the bronze layer of Lakehouse1 in the Delta format. \u2022 No changes other than changes to the file formats must be implemented before the data lands in the bronze layer. \u2022 Development effort must be minimized and a built-in connection must be used to import the source data. \u2022 In the event of a connectivity error, the ingestion processes must attempt the connection again. Lakehouses, data pipelines, and notebooks must be stored in WorkspaceA. Semantic models, reports, and dataflows must be stored in WorkspaceB. Once a week, old files that are no longer referenced by a Delta table log must be removed. Requirements. Data Transformation In the POS1 product data, ProductID values are unique. The product dimension in the gold layer must include only active products from product list. Active products are identified by an IsActive value of 1. Some product categories and subcategories are NOT assigned to any product. They are NOT analytically relevant and must be omitted from the product dimension in the gold layer. Requirements. Data Security - Security in Fabric must meet the following requirements: \u2022 The data engineers must have read and write access to all the lakehouses, including the underlying files. \u2022 The data analysts must only have read access to the Delta tables in the gold layer. \u2022 The data analysts must NOT have access to the data in the bronze and silver layers. \u2022 The data engineers must be able to commit changes to source control in WorkspaceA. You need to recommend a solution to resolve the MAR1 connectivity issues. The solution must minimize development effort. What should you recommend?",

Litware also manages an online\nadvertising business for the authors it represents.\nExisting Environment. Fabric Environment\nLitware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.\nThe company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.\nExisting Environment. Data Processing\nThe retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a\ncentral enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\nLitware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP\nsystem as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and\nsilver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.\nLitware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.\nExisting Environment. Sales Data\nMonth-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.\nIn the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.\nThe sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the\nfollowing fields of the source:\nSales Date -\nAuthor -\nPrice -\nUnits -\nSKU -\nA table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors\nauthenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.\nExisting Environment. Security Groups\nLitware has the following security groups:\n\nSales -\nFabric Admins -\nStreaming Admins -\nExisting Environment. Performance Issues\nBusiness users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for\ntwo hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the\nreports fail to load: \u201cThe SQL query failed while running.\u201d\nThe data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.\nWhen the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.\nThe company\u2019s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.\nRequirements. Planned Changes -\nLitware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service\n(Amazon S3) buckets.\nLitware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.\nRequirements. Version Control -\nLitware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.\nRequirements. Governance Requirements\nTo control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.\nRequirements. Data Requirements -\nLitware identifies the following data requirements:\nProcess the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).\nMake the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.\nWhen a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.\nYou need to troubleshoot the ad-hoc query issue.\nHow should you complete the statement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area.\nNOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.\n\nCorrect Answer:\n\nTopic 3\nQuestion #2\nCase Study -\nThis is a case study.

Litware also manages an online\nadvertising business for the authors it represents.\nExisting Environment. Fabric Environment\nLitware has a Fabric workspace named Workspace1. High concurrency is enabled for Workspace1.\nThe company has a data engineering team that uses Python for data processing.\nExisting Environment. Data Processing\nThe retail bookstores send sales data at the end of each business day, while the online bookstore constantly provides logs and sales data to a\ncentral enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\nLitware implements a medallion architecture by using the following three layers: bronze, silver, and gold. The sales data is ingested from the ERP\nsystem as Parquet files that land in the Files folder in a lakehouse. Notebooks are used to transform the files in a Delta table for the bronze and\nsilver layers. The gold layer is in a warehouse that has V-Order disabled.\nLitware has image files of book covers in Azure Blob Storage. The files are loaded into the Files folder.\nExisting Environment. Sales Data\nMonth-end sales data is processed on the first calendar day of each month. Data that is older than one month never changes.\nIn the source system, the sales data refreshes every six hours starting at midnight each day.\nThe sales data is captured in a Dataflow Gen1 dataflow. When the dataflow runs, new and historical data is captured. The dataflow captures the\nfollowing fields of the source:\n\u2022 Sales Date\n\u2022 Author\n\u2022 Price\n\n\u2022 Units\n\u2022 SKU\nA table named AuthorSales stores the sales data that relates to each author. The table contains a column named AuthorEmail. Authors\nauthenticate to a guest Fabric tenant by using their email address.\nExisting Environment. Security Groups\nLitware has the following security groups:\n\u2022 Sales\n\u2022 Fabric Admins\n\u2022 Streaming Admins\nExisting Environment. Performance Issues\nBusiness users perform ad-hoc queries against the warehouse. The business users indicate that reports against the warehouse sometimes run for\ntwo hours and fail to load as expected. Upon further investigation, the data engineering team receives the following error message when the\nreports fail to load: \u201cThe SQL query failed while running.\u201d\nThe data engineering team wants to debug the issue and find queries that cause more than one failure.\nWhen the authors have new book releases, there is often an increase in sales activity. This increase slows the data ingestion process.\nThe company\u2019s sales team reports that during the last month, the sales data has NOT been up-to-date when they arrive at work in the morning.\nRequirements. Planned Changes -\nLitware recently signed a contract to receive book reviews. The provider of the reviews exposes the data in Amazon Simple Storage Service\n(Amazon S3) buckets.\nLitware plans to manage Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the authors. The SEO data will be streamed from a REST API.\nRequirements. Version Control -\nLitware plans to implement a version control solution in Fabric that will use GitHub integration and follow the principle of least privilege.\nRequirements. Governance Requirements\nTo control data platform costs, the data platform must use only Fabric services and items. Additional Azure resources must NOT be provisioned.\nRequirements. Data Requirements -\nLitware identifies the following data requirements:\n\u2022 Process the SEO data in near-real-time (NRT).\n\u2022 Make the book reviews available in the lakehouse without making a copy of the data.\n\u2022 When a new book cover image arrives in the Files folder, process the image as soon as possible.\nWhat should you do to optimize the query experience for the business users?\nA. Enable V-Order.\nB. Create and update statistics. Most Voted\n\nC. Run the VACUUM command.\nD. Introduce primary keys."
